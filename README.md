Controlling an epaper screen with signalk

In the Run folder are a few template scripts that show data on a waveshare 2.13 epaper screen.
The temp.py script tries to get specific data from a SignalK server on the router of the network. 

The idea is to have an external screen displaying vessel data in an Openplotter environment.
